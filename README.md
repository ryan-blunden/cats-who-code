# Cats Who Code

Instragram like feed but of cats or kittens who either are coding, or think they're coding. Used for learning Docker and AWS.

## System Requirements

- Docker for Mac/Widows (if you're on Linux, you'll know what to do).
- Make.

## To get the app running

Then once the containers are running, head to http://localhost:3000/run-app-locally/ to complete setting up the application.
