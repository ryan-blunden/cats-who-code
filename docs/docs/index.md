# Welcome to the Cats Who Code Docs

The Cats Who Code App is a Python Web Application, designed to test a DevOps Engineer's ability to deploy a (semi) real world application into a production worthy AWS environment.

It is designed to challenge or certify your ability to create the best possible infrastructure and deployment process possible.

!!! note "Note"

    While it is a Python application, no Python experience is required. This is about AWS, not Python develpment.
    
    That being said, if you're a Python or Django developer and you'd like to add features by way of a pull-request, feel free.
    
It also serves a playground for experimenting with AWS services in the context of a real application with enough complexity to make the implementation non-trivial.

## How the Cats Who Code helps when training students in AWS

When I teach AWS, I want students to work as closely as is possible and practical to the way they would in the real world, taking into account the same things they'll need to consider when on the job. That's why I created this application.

The Cats Who Code application has been designed to use the most common AWS services taught (e.g. RDS, ElastiCache, VPC, EC2, Lambda, DynamoDB etc). 

The AWS knowledge required to deploy the application is at a beginner-intermediate level.
