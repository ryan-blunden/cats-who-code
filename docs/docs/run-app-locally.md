# Running the App Locally

## Bringing up the stack

From the project root directory and run
 
    make stack-dev ARGS=--build

This will build the local Docker images and run the containers using Docker Compose.

Once the stack has finished coming up, ensure the app is receiving requests by going to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

The app is not yet in a healthy state as the MySQL database has not been created. You'll see an error something like `django.db.utils.OperationalError: (1049, "Unknown database 'catswhocode'")` so so lets continue.

## Initializing the MySQL database

From the project root, change into the `catswhocode/app` (The Django application directory).

Then setup the MySQL database that Django uses by running the following commands:

    make db-create-dev
    make migrate    

## Health Check

The health check should return all systems normal. [http://localhost:8080/health-check/](http://localhost:8080/health-check/).

## The final test - Login to the admin

First, create a `superuser` account by running the following command:

    make superuser

Visit [http://localhost:8080/manage/](http://localhost:8080/manage/) using the details you entered.

## Creating your first Cat upload

Head to [http://localhost:8080/manage/cats/cat/](http://localhost:8080/manage/cats/cat/) and upload a Cat coding photo.

You can (presuming you set the photo to approved) see the photo in the cats feed at [http://localhost:8080/api/v1/cats/](http://localhost:8080/api/v1/cats/).
